# Nixbook-autoinstall
My take on Nixbook and increasing the automation of the install to make it as simple as possible.
Far and away the bulk of the work was done by Mike Kelly, this project is found at https://github.com/mkellyxp/nixbook

For now, all I'm doing is adding the custom configuration.nix that will run the necessary scripts to set up the Nixbook project as it is available from the nixbook repo. I hope to provide an ISO later.
